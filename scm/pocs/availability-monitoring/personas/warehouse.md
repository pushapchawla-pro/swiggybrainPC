# Warehouse Team Persona

## Overview

**Mission**: Run warehouse operations to ensure stock that exists in the warehouse is quickly made available and moves to pods in time. Fix capacity, putaway, and outbound issues that limit supply to pods.

**Operating Level**: Warehouse level or Warehouse × Category level (fixes warehouse capacity, putaway, and outbound flows)

## Systems & Tools

### Current Systems

| System | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **Vinculum WMS** | Third-party WMS handling PO management, inwarding, picking, packing, dispatching (being replaced with in-house WMS) |
| **MIM (Master Inventory Management)** | PO creation, amendment, supplier master management |
| **Booking Portal** | Vendor slot management for appointments |
| **KMS** | Warehouse master data, FC profiles |
| **Zoho** | Finance integration, compliance |

### In-House WMS (Being Built)

The warehouse team is transitioning to an in-house WMS due to:
- Vinculum frequent downtimes (1-2 instances/week)
- API timeouts and high SLAs
- Limited customization capability
- High vendor dependency
- Cost: Rs 4-5 Cr annually

**New WMS Modules**:
- Gate Pass Module (App + Web)
- Receiving System
- GRN Module
- Putaway System
- User Management with Geofencing

### Dashboards & Monitoring

| Dashboard | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **Inbound Dashboard** | Track ASN creation, receiving status, putaway completion, ageing |
| **Inventory Validator** | Validate MRP and shelf life before dispatch |
| **Warehouse Capacity Dashboard** | Monitor capacity utilization, slot bookings |
| **Movement Planning Portal** | View and manage warehouse-to-pod network |

---

## Key Metrics (KPIs)

| Metric | Description | Target |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| **GRN TAT** | Time from vehicle arrival to GRN completion | Benchmark varies by category |
| **Putaway TAT** | Time from GRN to inventory available in bins | < 24 hours critical |
| **Outbound Fill Rate** | % of movement plan quantity actually dispatched | 100% |
| **Inward to Putaway Time** | Time from receiving to shelf availability | Category-specific SLA |
| **Capacity Utilization** | % of warehouse capacity used | Monitored at slot × business type level |
| **WH Availability** | % time items available at warehouse level | Part of 99.9% target |
| **Inwarding TAT Adherence** | % of courier supply inwarded same-day | 100% |

---

## Common Issues Handled

| Issue Type | Description | Impact |
|------------|-------------|--------|
| **Capacity Capped** | Warehouse dispatch capacity exceeded | Movement plan cannot be fulfilled |
| **Putaway Delayed** | Inwarding to shelf delayed | Stock exists but not available for picking |
| **Outbound Fill Rate Low** | Warehouse outbound fill rate <80% | PODs don't receive planned quantities |
| **GRN Delays** | GRN not completed due to system issues | Inventory not reflected, blocks inwarding |
| **Appointment Slot Issues** | Vendors not adhering to slots, capacity exhausted | Inbound delays cascade to availability |
| **Manpower Shortage** | Insufficient pickers/loaders | Movement plan execution delayed |
| **Cold Storage Constraints** | Cold/fresh capacity full | Category-specific availability issues |

### Recent RCA Examples

- **Incorrect MRP Inwarding**: MRP mismatch between Vinculum and master data causing pricing issues
- **Vinculum API Latencies**: Caused PO creation failures, item sync delays
- **GRN Data Sync Failures**: Null MRP values from Vinculum blocking invoice creation

## RCA Branch Mapping

### Warehouse-Owned Waterfall Codes

These are the actual `final_reason` values from `analytics.public.sku_wise_availability_rca_with_reasons_v7`:

| Waterfall Code | `final_reason` | Description | Warehouse Action |
|----------------|----------------|-------------|------------------|
| `instock_9` | `WH Cap Missed` | Warehouse dispatch capacity exceeded | Increase dispatch capacity, prioritize critical SKUs |
| `instock_10` | `WH_Cap_Movement_Reduced` | Movement reduced due to WH constraints | Adjust capacity allocation |
| `instock_12` | `wh_ob_Fillrate Issue` | Warehouse outbound fill rate <80% | Improve picking/staging operations |
| `instock_15` | `wh_putaway_delay` | Free DOH <3 days (stock stuck in staging) | Clear putaway backlog |

### RCA Branch: A3 - Warehouse Throughput & Capacity

| Sub-Branch | Waterfall Code | Description |
|------------|----------------|-------------|
| **A3.1** Low Outbound Fill Rate | `wh_ob_Fillrate Issue` | Picking/packing bottlenecks |
| **A3.2** WH Capacity Constraints | `WH Cap Missed`, `WH_Cap_Movement_Reduced` | Dispatch capacity exceeded |
| **A3.3** Putaway Delays | `wh_putaway_delay` | Stock stuck in staging (free DOH <3 days) |

### Shared Ownership Cases

When `ai_owner = "Warehouse / Planning"`:
- **Warehouse handles**: Capacity execution, putaway, outbound operations
- **Planning handles**: Movement design, DOH cutoffs, allocation settings

## Stakeholder Interactions

| Stakeholder | Interaction Type |
|-------------|------------------|
| **Planning Team** | Receives movement plans, provides feedback on execution constraints |
| **Procurement Team** | Coordinates on PO creation, amendments, vendor appointments |
| **Pod Ops Team** | Ensures timely dispatch to pods, handles returns from pods |
| **Vendors/Suppliers** | Manages inbound appointments, GRN processes |
| **Finance Team** | Zoho integration for invoices, debit notes, compliance |
| **ERP Team** | Vinculum integration, master data sync |
| **Quality Team** | QC processes, shelf life management, MRP validation |
| **IT/Infra** | HDD devices, warehouse infrastructure, WMS systems |

## SOPs & Playbooks

### Diagnosis SOP for Warehouse Issues

1. **Check** warehouse capacity settings and movement cutoffs for the affected brand/category versus actual demand
2. **Review** warehouse outbound fill rate and missed quantity for the impacted pods and SKUs
3. **Check** inbound-to-putaway time for these SKUs against benchmark
4. **Confirm** whether stock existed in warehouse but failed to move to pods in time
5. **Identify** the main warehouse constraint (capacity, manpower, system issue)
6. **Escalate** to relevant team if constraint is upstream (procurement, vendor)

### Standard Operating Procedures

| SOP | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| **Gate Pass SOP** | Standard process for vehicle entry, docking, gate-out |
| **GRN Reconciliation SOP** | Steps to verify invoice vs received quantities |
| **Putaway SOP** | System-directed vs user-directed putaway rules |
| **Capacity Update SOP** | How to update warehouse capacity via file upload |
| **WMS User Management SOP** | User onboarding, geofencing, access management |

## Agent Integration

**When to route to Warehouse Team**:
- RCA points to "WH capacity capped", "putaway delayed", "outbound fill rate low"
- Pattern is warehouse-wide or warehouse × category (not isolated pod issues)
- Stock exists in WH but not reaching pods

**Key Signals to Surface**:
- WH capacity settings vs demand
- Outbound fill rate %
- Putaway TAT vs benchmark
- Movement plan execution status
- Slot capacity utilization

**Availability Issue Handling Flow**:
```
Alert: WH × Category Level Issue
    ↓
Warehouse Team Diagnosis:
1. Check WH capacity settings vs demand
2. Review outbound fill rate
3. Check putaway TAT
4. Identify constraint type
    ↓
Actions:
- Capacity capped → Adjust capacity allocation or flexi manpower
- Putaway delayed → Clear backlog, increase manpower
- Fill rate low → Investigate picking/packing bottleneck
- System issue → Escalate to tech team
```

**Action Verbs**: Check, Review, Confirm, Identify, Escalate, Adjust
