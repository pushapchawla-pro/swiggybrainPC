# Inventory & PO Management: Deep Dive Analysis

**Date:** January 20, 2026  


---

## 1. Core Problem Identified

A structural issue is causing **low fill rates**, affecting **30–50% of SKUs**. The primary drivers are:
- Vendor appointment and delivery challenges
- POs not being raised at the right time or for the correct quantity
- Inconsistencies in the system's logic for maintaining maximum Days of Inventory (DOI)

**Key Question:** Is this a consistent enough problem?

**Recommendation:** Focus analysis only on **non-courier POs** to simplify data interpretation.

---

## 2. PO Raising Logic

### When is a PO Raised?
- **Trigger:** Warehouse + In Transit ≤ 12 days DOH
- **Exception:** Unless forecasting is less than min DOH

### Why POs Are Not Raised at the Right Time & Quantity
- Appointment system issues (ruled out as primary cause)
- Systems involved: Vinculum, Multistore, WH, VM, Atal
- Static DOH parameters not adapting to demand changes

### PO Expiry Handling
- When PO gets expired after lead time → system should re-raise new PO
- Need to track appointments via **Booking table** for appointment codes
- Example: 100 ordered → 20 not delivered → new PO should be raised

---

## 3. Case Study: Instant Coffee SKU Stock-Out

A specific SKU (instant coffee) was investigated to trace the root cause of unavailability.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Availability | 30% |
| Warehouse Stock | 0 |
| Current DOI | 27 days |
| Lead Time | 10 days |
| Stock Sufficiency | 17 days |

**Key Questions:**
- When did WH stock = 0?
- Why didn't the system trigger a PO sooner when stock efficiency dropped below threshold?
- Why did we not raise 192 units the previous time?

---

## 4. Framework for Investigating Stock Issues

When analyzing any stock-out, split the investigation into:

1. **Was the PO raised or not?**
2. **What was the demand after?**
3. **When did the PO get delivered and what was the lead time?**
4. **Attribution:** We didn't give the order vs. Vendor did not deliver

### Natural Demand Analysis
- Natural demand = Run rate based on **availability corrected sales**
- Get weekly availability data for last 3 months
- Track run rate changes weekly (SOS)
- Pod served by the warehouse mapping

### Visualization Needed
- Warehouse quantity, open POs, aging, and fulfillment dates
- Dashboard for tracking "Why did we not raise X units previous time"
- Increase DOH visibility → that's why PO is raised

---

## 5. Fill Rate Issues

### Fill Rate is a Function of Two Things:
1. **Vendor itself was chronic** (consistent underperformance)
2. **No appointment** granted/taken

### Key Findings
- **20% of POs have multiple deliveries** (complicates tracking)
- Cross-check last 60-day PO vs GRN to identify wealth issue or not
- PO closed → should be present in GRN code
- When GRN exists → could map to 2 POs
- Some cases: No appointment but still delivered the POs

### Appointment Tracking Gaps
- Earlier 3PL system had **no records**
- Need to extract fills to check appointments
- How to track appointments systematically?

---

## 6. Capacity & Inbound Constraints

### The Search: Capacity is the Cost
**TAM Formula:** Persona × Conversion × AP/item = TAM
- (Avg item sold/pod) × No. of Pods × Price

### Capacity Utilization Target
- **BSA goal:** Utilize capacity effectively
- **85% of inbound should happen in 0–5 bucket**
- OOS situations arise when capacity isn't optimized

### Capacity Constraints Identified
- PO Cap on vendor level is **not added in the system**
- Need to understand: What capacity can we add? What is the current capacity?
- If runrate increases → Procurement runrate should increase (forward-looking sales)

---

## 7. MOV/MOQ Challenges

- Problem: MOV/MOQ constraints causing issues — not getting the right quantities
- Need to maintain stock **till 30th DOH to meet the MOV**
- Solution approach: **Convince the brand** on MOV flexibility
- Why 12 DOH? → Need to question static parameters

### Case In → Case Out Logic
- Earlier: 1 case → move into the pod
- Issue: We did/didn't give order AND vendor did not deliver
- Threshold: Less than 20 units triggers issues

---

## 8. PO Raising Issues Identified

### Quantity Issues
- A 96-piece PO was raised when stock was 64 units — but should have been **144 units** based on past operating levels
- System suggested quantity was sometimes **zero** despite clear need
- Rounding logic flaw: quantities were rounded down, potentially causing non-delivery
- Calculation example: 12 × 5.3 = 63 → 68.4 → rounded to 17

### Timing Issues
- Stock dropped from 200 to 37 units, but no PO was issued
- Around **December 13th**, PO was not raised despite stock depletion
- POs were only raised when stock position was near zero — reactive, not proactive

### Timeline Observations
- Warehouse stock went to zero between **January 7th** and the meeting date
- A 96-piece PO took **11 days** to deliver
- Open POs increased, but gaps existed where no PO was raised during active depletion
- Lead time benchmark: ~1000 (example timeline: 1000 → increments of 10 → >1001 → 1000)

---

## 9. Demand at Hand (DH) Calculation Gap

**Critical Finding:** Current calculations are based only on **warehouse DH**, but should also account for **Dark Store (DS) depletion**.

- Ordering needs to replace stock in both warehouse and dark stores
- This was not factored on December 7th
- Including DS gap increases the overall ordering number
- Order quantity formula: `Move Quantity + Efficiency` → e.g., 5.5 × 12 = 63 (rounded)


---

## 10. Systemic Issues & Recommendations

### Issues Identified
- Static 12-day stock sufficiency parameter may be causing out-of-stock situations
- Weekly inverting cycles for certain vendors create stockout risk if system isn't flexible
- Gap in material availability when PO enters initial state after being raised
- Data gaps: e.g., 144 units in transit with no clear record of release date
- **Recurrence of patterns** not being detected/flagged

### Problem: Why Not Getting Solved?
- No instrumentation in process
- Earlier 3PL system had no records
- PO Cap on vendor level not in the system

### Prioritization Framework

| Priority | Category | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| 1 | Popular Brand | High GMV impact |
| 2 | Before 2→ | Early intervention needed |
| — | OBT everyone | Chronic issue flagging |

### Recommendations

1. **"Brain" Application Use Cases:**
   - Alert users to stale data problems
   - Suggest better ordering decisions
   - Predict which items will go out of stock for proactive intervention
   - Identify recurring issues (e.g., appointment logic for specific vendors) and prioritize fixes
   - Flag **consistent patterns** from historical data

2. **Capacity Constraint Optimization:**
   - If inverting capacity is the bottleneck, change prioritization logic
   - Maintain sufficient stock sufficiency for non-critical brands
   - Optimize which SKUs are inverted if capacity cannot be increased

3. **Focus Deep Dives on High-Impact Issues:**
   - Prioritize top 2–3 issues (e.g., **demand forecasting**)
   - Deprioritize small issues like MO availability (only 0.5% of total availability)
   - Conduct **daily reviews** of PO and inventory issues

## 11. Key Takeaways

| Issue | Impact | Action |
|-------|--------|--------|
| PO quantity incorrect | Under-ordering leads to stockouts | Review calculation logic, include DS depletion |
| PO timing delayed | Reactive ordering vs proactive | Lower trigger thresholds, automate alerts |
| Appointment system gaps | Delivery failures not tracked | Automate gate pass checks, improve record-keeping, use Booking table |
| Static DOI parameters | Inflexible to demand changes | Make parameters dynamic based on run rate |
| Demand forecasting gaps | Root cause of availability issues | Prioritize for deep dive analysis |
| Fill rate issues | 20% POs have multiple deliveries | Cross-check 60-day PO vs GRN, identify chronic vendors |
| Capacity not in system | PO cap on vendor level missing | Add vendor-level capacity constraints |
| MOV constraints | Forced to order more to meet MOV | Negotiate with brands, target 30th DOH |
