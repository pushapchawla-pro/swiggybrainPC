# Learnings: Deep Dive into Instamart Supply Chain & Availability Problems
**Date**: January 16, 2025

## Context

This document synthesizes learnings from a deep dive into Instamart's supply chain operations, focusing on understanding why availability problems persist despite extensive data and reporting infrastructure. Based on meetings with procurement team, analysis of their daily RCA reports, conversations with the buy team, and operational flow mapping.

### Key Insight
**The flow has many handoffs.** Each handoff is a potential failure point where coordination gaps can cause availability issues.

## 2. Key Operational Concepts & Definitions

| Term | Definition | Business Impact |
|------|------------|-----------------|
| **DOH** (Days of Holding) | Current Stock ÷ Average Daily Sale | Core inventory health metric. Determines when to reorder. |
| **In-transit DOH** | In-transit Stock ÷ Current Run Rate | Measures days of inventory coverage from stock already on the way (PO raised but not yet inwarded). |
| **MOQ/MOV** | Minimum Order Quantity/Value required by supplier | Constrains ordering flexibility, especially for low-velocity SKUs. |
| **RTV** (Return to Vendor) | Products returned to supplier (expired, damaged, slow-moving) | Impacts planning accuracy, supplier relationships, margins. |
| **Fill Rate** | % of ordered quantity delivered by supplier | Primary supplier performance metric. Low fill rate = availability risk. |
| **QFR** (Quantity Fill Rate) | Total GRN quantity / Total PO quantity (60-day window) | Standardized supplier reliability measurement. |
| **Run Rate** | Average daily consumption per SKU per store cluster | Used for demand planning and sufficiency calculations. |
| **PO Sufficiency** | PO quantity vs expected consumption till next replenishment | Determines if order quantity will meet demand. |
| **Lead Time** | Vendor production + dispatch + transit + appointment + inwarding | Typical: 10-12 days. Critical for planning buffer. |
| **GRN** (Goods Receipt Note) | Warehouse inward posting confirming receipt | Triggers inventory availability in system. |
| **Putaway** | Moving inward stock to correct storage location | Delay here = delay in availability to PODs. |
| **Bradman** | Top-priority SKUs | Highest monitoring, fastest resolution. |
| **Band 1-4** | SKU performance tiers | Lower bands = less monitoring, more tribal knowledge. |

## 3. Meeting Notes: Procurement Operations Deep Dive

### Meeting with Mahesh (Procurement Team)

#### How Demand Forecasting Works
- **Demand Planning** looks at existing stock and uses **ARS (Auto-Replenishment System)** logic
- System determines how much to buy based on:
  - Current inventory levels (DOH)
  - Historical consumption patterns
  - Run rate (standard vs actual)
- **Problem**: Multiple systems may not be in sync
  - Analytics may use one forecasting approach
  - Movement Planning may use another model
  - Mismatch causes either overstocking or stockouts

#### Procurement Workflow
1. **PO Raising**: IM Corp team raises POs to suppliers based on demand planning
2. **Procurement Monitoring**: Ensures the inwarding process happens within lead time
3. **Appointment Scheduling**: Supplier gets time slot for warehouse delivery
4. **Tracking**: Monitor if supplier delivered on time, correct quantity
5. **Escalation**: If supplier misses delivery, procurement/category manager intervenes

#### Key Metrics Tracked
- **Fill Rate by Supplier**: QFR calculated over 60 days
- **PO Expiry**: POs have validity period; if not fulfilled, they expire
- **Inward Delays**: Time between GRN and putaway completion
- **DOH by SKU**: Warehouse inventory health

#### Supplier Performance
- **QFR > 90%**: Good supplier
- **QFR 70-90%**: Moderate concerns, monitoring needed
- **QFR < 70%**: Critical supplier, escalation to Category Manager

#### Warehouse Operations
- **Vinculum WMS**: Third-party warehouse management system
- **MIM** (Master Inventory Management): In-house ERP
- **Capacity Constraints**: Major issue - warehouse may not have space for inward even if PO raised

#### Movement Planning (Warehouse → POD)
- **Based on DOH and Run Rate**: If POD DOH < threshold, trigger replenishment
- **PO Sufficiency Check**: Will this order cover demand till next replenishment?
- **Lead Time Buffer**: Account for transit time, appointment delays

## 4. Data Infrastructure: Procurement RCA Table

### Key Observation

**The data exists. The reporting is granular.** Teams can drill down to:
- Which SKU went OOS
- Which supplier didn't deliver
- What was the fill rate
- Was appointment given on time
- What is the DOH situation

**So why do availability problems persist?**

## 5. The Three Core Problems (Despite Data Availability)

### Problem 1: PO Expiry Due to Warehouse Capacity

**Scenario:**
- IM Corp team raises PO based on demand planning
- Appointment scheduled for supplier delivery
- Supplier ready to deliver
- **But**: Warehouse capacity full, cannot accept inward
- PO expires without fulfillment
- SKU goes OOS at POD level

**Root Cause:**
- **Coordination Gap**: PO raised without real-time warehouse capacity check
- **System Gap**: PO system and warehouse capacity system not integrated
- **Accountability Gap**: Who is responsible - IM Corp (raised PO), Procurement (monitors process), or Warehouse (didn't inward)?

**Current State:**
- Teams track PO expiry in dashboards
- **But**: By the time it's visible in reports, it's too late
- Manual intervention needed to reschedule or raise new PO

### Problem 2: Demand Planning - Run Rate Mismatch

**Scenario:**
- **Example SKU**: Ashirvad Atta 2kg in a specific city
- **ARS (Average Run Rate Standard)**: 100 units/day (based on historical average)
- **Actual Sales**: 150 units/day (current reality)
- **PO Raised Based On**: 100 units/day (ARS)
- **Result**: Insufficient stock, SKU goes OOS

**Root Cause:**
- **Forecast Lag**: Standard run rate doesn't adapt quickly to demand changes
- **System Mismatch**: Multiple forecasting systems (ARS, Movement Planning model) may have different values
- **Execution Gap**: Even if data shows mismatch, updating ARS requires manual approval/process

**Current State:**
- Teams can see run rate mismatch in reports
- **But**: Reaction is slow, by the time it's fixed, stockout has occurred

### Problem 3: Incentive Misalignment - Tribal Knowledge vs Documented Knowledge

**Scenario:**
- **Top 100 Brands + Bradman + Band 1-2 SKUs**: Heavily documented, monitored daily, fast resolution
- **Band 3, Band 4, Long-tail SKUs**: Monitoring relies on tribal knowledge, inconsistent

**Example:**
- Band 1 SKU goes OOS → Procurement RCA done within hours → Category Manager alerted → Supplier expedited
- Band 4 SKU goes OOS → May not be noticed for days → No clear owner → Supplier not contacted

**Root Cause:**
- **Attention & Scale Gap**: Teams physically cannot monitor 10,000+ SKUs manually
- **Incentive Structure**: Teams rewarded for maintaining availability on high-priority SKUs
- **Documentation Gap**: Supplier-specific issues (e.g., "Supplier X always underdelivers in March") exist in people's heads, not in systems

**Current State:**
- Brand SCM knows supplier issues via emails/calls
- Category Managers know which suppliers are unreliable
- **But**: Knowledge not systematically captured, not accessible to others

## 6. Root Cause Analysis: Why Problems Persist Despite Data

### The Paradox
- ✅ **Knowledge exists**: Teams know which suppliers are unreliable
- ✅ **Data exists**: RCA tables have granular drill-down
- ✅ **Actions exist**: Teams know what to do (expedite, switch supplier, increase buffer)
- ❌ **Problems persist**: Availability issues continue

### The Real Constraints

| Constraint | Description | Impact |
|------------|-------------|--------|
| **Coordination & Accountability** | Information doesn't reach right person at right time with clear ownership | When PO raised AND appointment given but still no delivery, who acts - Procurement or CatM? |
| **Attention & Scale** | Teams can only humanly monitor Top 100 brands + Bradman + Band 1-2 | Band 3, Band 4, long-tail SKUs have availability issues that go unnoticed |
| **Proactive Prediction** | Current system is reactive (know OOS happened, don't know what will go OOS) | By the time problem shows in dashboard, it's too late to prevent |
| **Execution Speed** | Even when problem identified, resolution takes time | Updating ARS, getting new PO approved, rescheduling appointment - all have delays |
| **Cross-System Gaps** | Multiple systems (MIM, Vinculum, Control Room, ARS) not fully integrated | PO system doesn't know warehouse capacity in real-time |

### Key Insight from User

> "I don't think the problem is lack of data or reports. I looked at their RCA reports and it's very granular."

**The problem is execution and coordination**, not visibility.

## 7. Connection to Strategic Framework (V0/V1/V2)

### How This Maps to the Proposed Solution

From `learnings/strategic-framework.md`, we have three solution versions:

#### V0: Reactive Intelligence with Proactive Routing

**Addresses**: Coordination & Attention Gaps

**How it helps based on today's learnings:**
- **Problem 1 (PO Expiry)**: System detects PO about to expire due to warehouse capacity → Routes alert to Warehouse Manager with action: "Clear space for SKU X inward by tomorrow"
- **Problem 3 (Long-tail SKUs)**: Extends monitoring to Band 3/4 SKUs that teams can't manually track → Alerts when Band 4 SKU shows early warning signs

**Example Action:**
```
Alert to Procurement Manager:
SKU: Ashirvad Atta 2kg | WH: Bangalore Main
Issue: PO #12345 expires in 2 days, no appointment scheduled
Action: Contact supplier for urgent appointment OR raise new PO with expedited delivery
```

#### V1: Predictive Intelligence

**Addresses**: Proactive Prediction Gap

**How it helps based on today's learnings:**
- **Problem 2 (Run Rate Mismatch)**: Predicts "Ashirvad 2kg will go OOS in 3 days because actual sales (150/day) > ARS (100/day) and current DOH is only 2 days"
- **Historical Learning**: "Last 5 times this happened, 3 were resolved by emergency PO with 30% buffer, 2 by temporary halt of promotional campaigns"

**Example Prediction:**
```
Prediction for SKU X:
Will go OOS: Jan 19 (3 days from now)
Reason: Supplier has 75% QFR in Jan (seasonal production constraint)
Recommended Action: Place backup order from Supplier Y (past success rate: 70%)
```

#### V2: Advanced Context & SKU-Specific Rules

**Addresses**: Dynamic Learning of Patterns

**How it helps based on today's learnings:**
- **Captures Tribal Knowledge**: "Supplier X always underdelivers Ashirvad 2kg in March due to capacity" → System learns this pattern → Automatically suggests ordering 2 weeks early in March
- **SKU × City × Supplier Specific**: Different rules for same SKU in different contexts

## 8. The "Lego Blocks" Concept (User's Proposal)

### User's Vision

Create a **map of what went right and what went wrong** at a granular level:

**Building Blocks:**

**1. PO Planning & Raising:**
- ✅ **PO raised on time** (yes/no, how early/late)
- ✅ **PO quantity correct** (yes/no, right quantity based on forecast and lead time)
- ✅ **Contract issues** (yes/no, any contractual blockers preventing PO raising)

**2. Supplier & Appointment:**
- ✅ **Appointment scheduled** (yes/no, on requested date or delayed)
- ✅ **Appointment within lead time** (yes/no, did vendor get appointment to deliver within standard lead time)
- ✅ **Supplier delivered** (yes/no, full quantity or partial)
- ✅ **Fill rate issue root cause known** (yes/no, buy team/procurement has exact reason in emails - production issue, raw material shortage, etc.)
- ✅ **Market-wide supply issue** (yes/no, is this a systemic production problem where vendor is not supplying to anyone, not just us)

**3. Warehouse Operations:**
- ✅ **Warehouse capacity available** (yes/no, did we have enough capacity to inward where POs were raised)
- ✅ **GRN posted timely** (yes/no, putaway delay)
- ✅ **Capacity blocked PO** (yes/no, PO raised correctly but warehouse doesn't have capacity to inward)

**4. Demand Planning & Movement:**
- ✅ **ARS and Movement Planning aligned** (yes/no, how tied is movement planning logic with ARS logic - currently not closely tied)
- ✅ **Movement to POD sufficient** (yes/no, based on run rate)
- ✅ **DOH maintained** (yes/no, above/below threshold)
- ✅ **Run rate alignment** (yes/no, ARS standard vs actual sales match)

**Chain Analysis Example 1:**
```
SKU X went OOS on Jan 16. Let's trace:
→ PO raised: ✅ (Jan 5, on time, correct quantity)
→ Contract issues: ✅ (No blockers)
→ Appointment scheduled: ✅ (Jan 8, as requested, within lead time)
→ Supplier delivered: ❌ (Only 60% of quantity)
→ Fill rate root cause: ✅ (Buy team email: "Supplier facing raw material shortage in Jan")
→ Market-wide issue: ✅ (Other retailers also affected - systemic problem)
→ Warehouse capacity: ✅ (Space available, no blockage)
→ Warehouse inward: ✅ (GRN posted same day)
→ ARS-Movement alignment: ⚠️ (Movement planning using different run rate)
→ Movement to POD: ⚠️ (Moved correct quantity but run rate increased)
→ Result: OOS at POD level

Root Cause: Market-wide supplier raw material shortage (60% fill rate) + Run rate mismatch between ARS and actual
Responsible: Category Manager (explore alternative suppliers) + Demand Planning (reconcile ARS with actual run rate)
Action: Emergency sourcing from alternate supplier + Update ARS to reflect current demand
```

**Chain Analysis Example 2:**
```
SKU Y went OOS on Jan 17. Let's trace:
→ PO raised: ✅ (Jan 6, on time, correct quantity)
→ Contract issues: ✅ (No blockers)
→ Appointment scheduled: ✅ (Jan 9, as requested)
→ Supplier delivered: ✅ (100% quantity, on time)
→ Warehouse capacity: ❌ (Warehouse at 95% capacity, could not accept inward)
→ Warehouse inward: ❌ (PO expired, no GRN posted)
→ Result: OOS at POD level

Root Cause: Warehouse capacity constraint - PO raised correctly but no space to inward
Responsible: Warehouse Manager (capacity planning) + IM Corp (should check capacity before raising PO)
Action: Cross-dock to another warehouse OR clear space by moving slow-moving inventory
```

### Why This Matters

Instead of just saying "fill rate issue" or "OOS happened", we can pinpoint:

**Example 1 (Supplier Issue):**
- **Which lego blocks failed**: Supplier delivery (60%) + ARS-Movement planning misalignment
- **Root cause clarity**: Market-wide raw material shortage (from Buy team emails)
- **Who is responsible**: Category Manager (alternate sourcing) + Demand Planning (fix run rate)
- **What worked correctly**: PO timing, quantity, appointment scheduling, warehouse operations
- **Actionable insight**: Not a supplier performance issue - it's a market constraint requiring alternate sourcing strategy

**Example 2 (Warehouse Capacity):**
- **Which lego block failed**: Warehouse capacity
- **Root cause clarity**: PO raised correctly, supplier delivered 100%, but no space to inward
- **Who is responsible**: Warehouse Manager + IM Corp (coordination gap)
- **What worked correctly**: PO planning, supplier delivery, appointment scheduling
- **Actionable insight**: Need real-time capacity check before PO raising OR dynamic re-routing to other warehouses

**Key Benefits:**
1. **Precise Attribution**: No ambiguity about where breakdown occurred
2. **Avoid Blame Shifting**: Data shows exactly which team/system caused the gap
3. **Targeted Actions**: Different failures require completely different solutions
4. **Pattern Recognition**: Similar lego block failures across SKUs indicate systemic issues
5. **Knowledge Capture**: Buy team/Procurement emails contain tribal knowledge about supplier-specific issues that need systematic extraction

## 9. Strategic Framework: Proposed Solution Approach

### 9.1 The Paradox

**Teams have the knowledge. Teams know the actions. Yet availability problems persist.**

**What We Know:**
- ✅ Knowledge exists
- ✅ People know the actions (Brand SCM knows supplier issues via emails/calls)
- ✅ Each Team does RCA daily (Procurement RCA, CatM RCA)
- ✅ Teams can track priority SKUs

### 9.2 Three Core Hypotheses for Why the Gap Exists

#### Gap 1: Coordination & Accountability Gap
Information exists but doesn't reach the right person at the right time with clear accountability. When multiple teams could act (Procurement, Catm, Brand SCM), ownership is unclear.

#### Gap 2: Attention & Scale Gap
Teams can only humanly monitor Top 100 brands and Bradman/Band 1/Band 2 SKUs. Band 3, Band 4, and long-tail SKUs have availability issues that go completely unnoticed - not because teams don't know what to do, but because it's impossible to track thousands of SKUs manually.

#### Gap 3: Proactive Prediction Gap
We don't know proactively what will go out of stock before it happens. We only find out after it's already OOS.

### 9.3 The Central Question

**Can Swiggy Brain solve these three gaps? Or will we just build an expensive dashboard showing problems everyone already knows about?**

### 9.4 What Success Looks Like

Teams taking action they wouldn't have taken without the system (both on priority SKUs caught earlier AND on long-tail SKUs they couldn't monitor before), resulting in measurable improvement in availability metrics.

### 9.5 The Risk

If we add GenAI prediction without fixing the underlying coordination problem AND extending monitoring beyond human capacity, we risk building an expensive dashboard that shows problems everyone already knows about.

### 9.6 Proposed Solutions

#### Version 0 (V0): Reactive Intelligence with Proactive Routing

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **What it does** | For events that already happened (D-1), route information proactively to the right person with the right action to take |
| **Example** | Yesterday, SKU X went OOS because supplier didn't deliver despite PO being raised and appointment given → System identifies Catm responsibility → Alerts Catm: "Contact supplier Y about missed delivery for SKU X, expedite or source from backup" |
| **Core Hypothesis** | Routing/alerting system will improve execution by solving Gaps 1 & 2 |
| **Value Proposition** | **Solves Gap 1**: Eliminates coordination gap by routing with clear accountability<br>**Solves Gap 2**: Extends team attention beyond Top 100 brands and Bradman/Band 1/Band 2 SKUs to Band 3, Band 4, and long-tail SKUs |
| **What we're testing** | • Can we correctly identify what happened, why it happened, who should act, and what action to take?<br>• Will this enable teams to maintain availability across a broader SKU base without additional headcount?<br>• Do Band 3/Band 4 SKUs have availability issues that go unnoticed simply because teams can't monitor everything? |

#### Version 1 (V1): Predictive Intelligence with Historical Action Learning

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **What it does** | Predict which SKUs will go OOS, explain why they will go OOS, show what actions were taken in similar past situations, and recommend future actions based on what worked |
| **Example** | SKU X will likely go OOS in 3 days because supplier has pattern of underdelivering in this season → In past 5 similar cases, 3 were resolved by expediting from backup supplier, 2 by increasing buffer from another warehouse → Recommend: Expedite from backup supplier (success rate 60%) |
| **Value Proposition** | **Solves Gap 3**: Moves from reactive to predictive. Learns from history to recommend actions with probabilistic success rates |
| **What we're testing** | • Can we predict accurately?<br>• Can we extract learnings from past actions (structured data + unstructured emails/calls)?<br>• Can we recommend actions that teams actually find useful? |

#### Version 2 (V2): Advanced Context Reasoning with SKU-Specific Rules

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **What it does** | Learn dynamic rules specific to each SKU × City × Supplier combination through context graphs, rather than applying generic rules across all SKUs |
| **Example** | **For SKU A in City X from Supplier Y**: Learn that underdelivery happens every March due to seasonal capacity constraints → Apply specific intervention (order 2 weeks early)<br><br>**For SKU B in City Z from Supplier W**: Learn that appointment delays cause issues → Apply different intervention (priority appointment scheduling) |
| **Status** | TBD - depends on learnings from V0 and V1 |
| **Other Possibilities** | • Reconciliation of multiple forecasting systems (Movement Planning vs other models)<br>• Autonomous action execution for low-risk, high-frequency scenarios<br>• Real-time feedback loops that improve recommendations based on human decisions |
| **Decision Point** | V2 scope will be defined based on V0/V1 validation results and where highest ROI opportunities emerge |

### 9.7 Our Goal with V0, V1 and V2

Prove that GenAI doesn't just predict, but actually solves:

**1. Coordination & Execution Gap by:**
- Routing information to the right person at the right time
- Providing clear action recommendations
- Establishing clear accountability

**2. Scale & Attention Gap by:**
- Extending monitoring to Band 3, Band 4, and long-tail SKUs
- Making it possible to maintain availability across thousands of SKUs without proportional headcount increase

**3. Proactive Prediction Gap by:**
- Predicting which SKUs will go OOS before it happens
- Learning from historical actions to recommend what works

### 9.8 Current Understanding: The Availability Problem

#### Major Root Causes

| Category | Sub-Components | Control Level |
|----------|----------------|---------------|
| **Fill Rate Issues** | **Vendor → Warehouse:**<br>• Supplier production issues<br>• Supplier reliability<br>• Vendor capacity constraints | Lower control |
| | **Movement Planning:**<br>• Warehouse → Pod inventory movement<br>• Appointment scheduling<br>• PO timing and quantity | Higher control |
| **Demand Forecasting** | • Analytics model forecasts on higher side for warehouse to pod movement plan<br>• Warehouse Ordering is based on Movement Planning demand or another model<br>• Systems may not be in sync, causing availability gaps | Mixed control |
| **Operational Constraints** | • OTIF issues<br>• MOV/MOQ constraints | Mixed control |

#### The Data & Knowledge Problem

| What Exists | Where It's Trapped | Issue |
|-------------|-------------------|-------|
| Procurement Team does RCA daily on troubled SKUs | Daily reports, dashboards | Knowledge exists but fragmented |
| Brand SCM knows supplier issues | Emails, phone calls with brands | Tribal knowledge - not systematically captured |
| Each SKU × City has unique failure reasons | Individual team member experience | Pattern recognition happens in human brains, not systems |
| Root cause information (production issues, delivery timing, appointment gaps) | Scattered across emails, calls, multiple systems | Even with Glean admin tokens, emails don't surface easily without specific mappings |

**Critical Unanswered Questions (that remain systematic blind spots):**
- Did we give the brand an appointment at the right time?
- If some brand came to take an appointment, do we know they actually came?
- If we didn't give them an appointment, do we know that we didn't?
- When we raised a PO, was it the right quantity?
- If supplier didn't deliver, what was the exact reason - production issue or something else?

#### The Attribution & Accountability Problem

| Surface Level | Reality | Gap |
|---------------|---------|-----|
| Dashboard shows "fill rate issue" | Multiple potential causes:<br>• When did we raise PO?<br>• Did we raise right quantity?<br>• When did we define to raise it?<br>• Did we give the appointment on time?<br>• Why exactly is brand not supplying - production issue, payment issue, capacity constraint? | If PO is raised AND appointment is given, who is responsible - Procurement or Catm? |
| Focus on Top 100 brands, Bradman, Band 1 & 2 SKUs | Band 3, Band 4, and long-tail SKUs get minimal attention | It's not humanly possible to monitor all SKUs manually - likely have availability issues that go unnoticed |
| Teams know what actions to take | Action playbooks exist:<br>• Catm has specific actions for certain scenarios<br>• Procurement has intervention options<br>• Brand SCM has supplier relationships | But ownership isn't always clear when multiple teams could act |

#### The Action Problem

**Teams know the actions - but then what's the issue?**

| Potential Root Cause | Evidence | Implication for Solution |
|---------------------|----------|--------------------------|
| Information not reaching right person at right time | Knowledge trapped in emails, calls, individual experience | Routing/alerting system could help |
| Unclear accountability when multiple teams could act | "If PO is raised and appointment is given, who is responsible?" | Need clear ownership mapping |
| Competing priorities causing execution gaps | Focus on Bradman/Band 1-2 leaves others unmonitored | System needs to prioritize and route |
| Human attention limits | Teams can only monitor high-priority SKUs manually | GenAI needed to extend monitoring to long-tail |
| Lack of confidence in which action will work | Multiple intervention options, unclear success rates | Need historical learning on action efficacy |

**Solutions Being Explored:**
- If brands cause the issue: Buy from market and debit brand for margin loss
- If supplier reliability is the pattern: Focus on supplier diversification rather than just prediction
- If it's appointment/PO timing: Better internal coordination without prediction

### 9.9 Critical Questions for the Team

#### Question 1: Knowledge exists but availability remains an issue - what's actually broken?

Procurement does daily RCA. Brand SCM knows via emails/calls why suppliers didn't deliver. Teams know what actions to take. Yet availability issues persist.

**Is the constraint**: coordination failure, accountability gaps, execution discipline, or human attention limits? If GenAI only provides earlier visibility into problems people already know about, have we solved anything?

#### Question 2: Where should GenAI focus - problems we can't control or problems we can?

Fill rate issues: Vendor → Warehouse (lower control) vs Movement Planning (higher control)

#### Question 3: Can GenAI extract insights from tribal knowledge - and should we for this POC?

Brand SCM knowledge lives in thousands of emails and call notes where the reason for why a particular supplier is not able to fulfill a particular SKU.

Glean can access with admin tokens if we specify which account manager handles which brand.

**Questions to resolve:**
- From a security perspective, should we use Glean admin tokens for account manager emails?

#### Question 4: How do competitors handle availability?

- How do direct competitors (Blinkit, Zepto, BBNow) and indirect competitors handle similar availability challenges?
- Do they face similar issues or have they solved this differently?
- Can we learn from their approaches?

#### Question 5: What level of solution are we building?

- **Level 1**: Predict OOS ("SKU X will be out of stock in 3 days")
- **Level 2**: Predict OOS with reason ("SKU X will be OOS because supplier missed delivery")
- **Level 3**: Predict OOS with reason and action ("SKU X will be OOS because supplier missed delivery → recommend expedite from backup supplier")

Which level solves the actual business problem? Do we need all three sequentially, or can we skip to Level 3 if that's where the value is?

#### Question 6: Do we need to map who does what before GenAI can recommend actions?

Different teams have different action playbooks:
- Catm has specific actions for certain scenarios
- Procurement has their intervention options
- When PO is raised and appointment is given, ownership between Procurement and Catm isn't always clear

#### Question 7: Where should GenAI add value - high-volume SKUs or long-tail?

Focus is heavily on Bradman and Band 1 & 2 SKUs. But what about remaining SKUs?

Should Swiggy Brain:
- Help prioritize which SKUs to focus on dynamically based on business impact?
- Focus POC on one segment where intervention ROI is highest?
- Try to solve availability across all SKUs?

What's the value distribution - is solving long-tail availability worth the complexity cost?

#### Question 8: How do we create the feedback loop to improve the model?

In human-augmentation mode:
1. GenAI predicts OOS + recommends action
2. Human sees prediction and recommendation
3. Human takes action, modifies it, or ignores it
4. Outcome occurs (OOS happened/didn't happen, action worked/didn't work)

We need to capture: Did human agree with prediction? Take recommended action? Modify it? What was outcome?

**Questions:**
- What instrumentation is needed to learn from human decisions?
- How does this feedback loop improve future predictions and recommendations?

#### Question 9: Do we need to map data sources before GenAI can learn from them?

We need both structured and unstructured data. Unstructured is accessible via Glean, but we need to tell Glean where to look:
- Which account manager handles which brand
- Which email addresses to query
- Which systems contain appointment data, PO data, delivery data
- Which Slack channels have relevant discussions

**Questions:**
- How long will this mapping take?
- Can we start POC with partial mapping, or does incomplete data invalidate proof of concept?

## 10. Key Takeaways & Next Steps

### Core Insights

1. **The problem is NOT lack of data** - Procurement RCA table is comprehensive with 30+ columns tracking everything from DOH to QFR to open POs
2. **The problem IS execution at scale** - Coordination gaps, attention limits (can only monitor Top 100/Bradman/Band 1-2), reactive vs proactive
3. **GenAI value hypothesis**: Not just prediction, but **routing + accountability + scale extension**
4. **Supply chain is simple**: Buy Team → Sell Team → Demand Planning (ARS) → IM Corp (raises PO) → Procurement (ensures fulfillment) → Warehouse → Movement Planning → POD → Customer
5. **The "lego blocks" concept**: Break down each availability problem into granular chain of what went right/wrong → Clear attribution

### What Must Be Proven

| Version | Must Prove |
|---------|------------|
| **V0** | Can we route right information to right person at right time, leading to action that prevents OOS on long-tail SKUs they couldn't monitor before? |
| **V1** | Can we predict OOS before it happens, with actionable recommendations based on historical learning? |
| **V2** | Can we learn SKU × City × Supplier specific patterns and apply targeted interventions? |
