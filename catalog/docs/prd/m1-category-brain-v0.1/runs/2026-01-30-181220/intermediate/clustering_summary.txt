OBSERVATIONS
------------
1. The dataset has high term diversity - most terms are unique enough to remain
   as singletons at threshold 0.75.

2. Multi-term clusters are primarily:
   - Singular/plural variants: "perfume"/"perfumes", "ghar soap"/"ghar soaps",
     "spray bottle"/"spray bottles"
   - Duplicate entries: Same brand appearing in different categories
     ("plum", "pilgrim", "rose water", "foxtale")

3. At threshold 0.75, spelling variants like "facewash"/"face wash" do NOT
   cluster (Jaccard similarity = 0.33). Consider lowering threshold if these
   should merge.

4. Brand-specific terms (cetaphil, dove, l'oreal, etc.) remain as singletons
   as expected - they have distinct trigram signatures.
