YoY Seasonality Summary
=======================
Run Date: 2026-01-30
OPD Growth Factor: 1.25
Total Terms Analyzed: 200

DATA LIMITATION NOTICE
======================
The IM_SEARCH_DB_SS table only contains data from 2025-11-01 to 2026-01-29 (~3 months).
YoY comparison requires 12+ months of historical data, which is NOT available.

Per task instructions, all terms have been defaulted to:
- SEASONALITY_FLAG: SEASONAL_NORMAL
- SEASONALITY_SCORE: 50

This means the YoY seasonality signal is UNAVAILABLE for this run.

Seasonality Distribution (Defaulted):
- NEW_TREND: 0 (not determinable without YoY data)
- ABOVE_SEASONAL: 0 (not determinable without YoY data)
- SEASONAL_NORMAL: 200 (defaulted due to missing historical data)
- BELOW_SEASONAL: 0 (not determinable without YoY data)

Top 5 Search Terms by Volume (No YoY Classification Available):
1. "condom" (58,652 volume, hygiene and wellness)
2. "face wash" (51,484 volume, bath body and hair)
3. "shampoo" (50,113 volume, bath body and hair)
4. "coconut oil" (48,614 volume, bath body and hair)
5. "toothbrush" (46,888 volume, hygiene and wellness)

RECOMMENDATION
==============
To enable YoY seasonality analysis in future runs:
1. Verify if historical data exists in another table or data warehouse
2. Request data backfill for IM_SEARCH_DB_SS if retention policy allows
3. Consider using alternative seasonality detection methods (e.g., MoM trends, Google Trends comparison)

ALTERNATIVE SIGNALS AVAILABLE
=============================
- CB-1 (MoM): Week-over-week velocity available from current data
- CB-2 (Google Trends): External seasonality proxy can supplement
- CB-3 (Signal Fusion): Will rely more heavily on MoM and GTrends signals
