Run ID: 2026-01-29-104830
Executed: 2026-01-29 11:05 IST
Source: pytrends API (with SSL workaround)

Configuration:
- Geo: India (IN)
- Timeframe: Last 3 months
- Batch size: 5 terms
- Delay between batches: 30 seconds
- Terms queried: 20

Output Files:
- terms_queried.csv - 20 terms with interest scores
- raw_responses.json - Full API response

Key Observations:
1. Many niche terms (soap paper, shampoo sachets) show 0 interest - too specific for Google Trends
2. Broad terms (shampoo, face wash, perfume) show healthy interest (46-54)
3. Most terms show MoM decline - typical post-holiday (January) seasonal pattern
4. "pregnancy test" shows +39% MoM growth - notable signal

Top Interest Scores (Current):
- shampoo: 54/100
- perfume: 51/100
- face wash: 46/100
- sunscreen: 34/100
- pregnancy test: 25/100

Growing Terms (MoM):
- pregnancy test: +38.9%

Declining Terms (seasonal):
- mehndi: -61.9% (post-wedding season)
- perfume: -40.7% (post-holiday)
- lipstick: -39.4% (post-holiday)

Data Quality Notes:
- SSL certificate issue required verify=False workaround
- Niche/long-tail terms don't have Google Trends data
- Internal Snowflake search data is more valuable for these specific terms
- Google Trends better for validating broad category trends

Status: SUCCESS (with caveats on data quality for niche terms)
